# E2-S2: Dev Log Quality Improvements

## Story
**As a** developer reviewing session summaries
**I want** dev log summaries to use the Stop event's AI-generated summary when available
**So that** I get meaningful descriptions of what was accomplished rather than just tool count statistics

## Status
- **Epic**: Polish & Reliability
- **Priority**: P2-Medium
- **Points**: 5
- **Sprint**: 2
- **Dependencies**: E1-S1 (DevLogTimeline must exist to display improved summaries)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC1: When a session ends with a Stop event that includes a `summary` field, the dev log uses that summary text verbatim
- [ ] AC2: When a session ends with a SessionEnd event that includes a `summary` field, the dev log uses that summary text
- [ ] AC3: When no summary is available from events, the dev log falls back to the auto-generated summary (current behavior from `buildAutoSummary()`)
- [ ] AC4: The auto-generated summary is improved to include more context: project name, branch, and a brief description of the primary activity (e.g., "Edited 3 files in src/components on branch feature/auth")
- [ ] AC5: Dev log entries in the DevLogTimeline visually distinguish between AI summaries and auto-generated ones (e.g., a small label or icon)
- [ ] AC6: The `--summarize` flag in `send_event.py` correctly triggers summary generation and sends it in the event payload

## Technical Notes

### Current Summary Flow
The `generateDevLog()` function in `enricher.ts` (lines 342-415) already checks for a summary from the Stop/SessionEnd event:

```typescript
// Lines 390-394:
const lastEvent = db.prepare(
  "SELECT summary FROM events WHERE session_id = ? AND source_app = ? AND hook_event_type IN ('Stop', 'SessionEnd') ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1"
).get(sessionId, sourceApp) as any;

const summary = lastEvent?.summary || buildAutoSummary(toolBreakdown, filesChanged.size, commits.length);
```

This logic is correct but depends on:
1. The hook sending a `summary` field in the Stop/SessionEnd event
2. The `events` table storing the `summary` column (it does - db.ts line 27)

### Hook Summary Generation
The `send_event.py` script (line 167-172) generates a summary when `--summarize` is passed:
```python
if args.summarize:
    summary = generate_event_summary(event_data)
    if summary:
        event_data['summary'] = summary
```

This calls `generate_event_summary()` from `utils/summarizer.py`. Check whether Stop and SessionEnd hooks actually pass `--summarize`.

### Auto-Summary Improvement
The current `buildAutoSummary()` (enricher.ts lines 417-431) produces generic output like "Session: 5 file edits, 3 commands across 4 files". Improve it to:

```typescript
function buildAutoSummary(
  toolBreakdown: Record<string, number>,
  fileCount: number,
  commitCount: number,
  projectName: string,
  branch: string
): string {
  const parts: string[] = [];

  const writes = (toolBreakdown['Write'] || 0) + (toolBreakdown['Edit'] || 0);
  const reads = toolBreakdown['Read'] || 0;
  const bashOps = toolBreakdown['Bash'] || 0;

  if (writes > 0) parts.push(`${writes} file edit${writes > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
  if (reads > 0) parts.push(`${reads} file read${reads > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
  if (bashOps > 0) parts.push(`${bashOps} command${bashOps > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);
  if (commitCount > 0) parts.push(`${commitCount} commit${commitCount > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);

  if (parts.length === 0) return `Brief session on ${projectName}/${branch}`;
  return `${parts.join(', ')} across ${fileCount} file${fileCount !== 1 ? 's' : ''} on ${branch}`;
}
```

### Client Indicator
In `DevLogTimeline.vue`, add a small indicator next to the summary text to show whether it was AI-generated or auto-generated. A simple heuristic: if the summary starts with "Session:" it's auto-generated (from `buildAutoSummary`). Otherwise it's likely from an AI summary.

Alternatively, add a `summary_source` field to the `DevLog` type: `'ai' | 'auto'`. This requires a schema migration.

**Simpler approach (no schema change)**: Use the heuristic on the client side. The auto-generated summaries always start with "Session:" or "Brief session". Check for these patterns.

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Verify that `stop.py` and `session_end.py` hooks pass `--summarize` flag to `send_event.py` (check hook files)
- [ ] Task 2: If hooks don't pass `--summarize`, update them to do so for Stop and SessionEnd events
- [ ] Task 3: Update `buildAutoSummary()` in `apps/server/src/enricher.ts` (line 417) to accept `projectName` and `branch` parameters and include them in the output
- [ ] Task 4: Update the call to `buildAutoSummary()` in `generateDevLog()` (line 394) to pass `projectName` and `session.current_branch`
- [ ] Task 5: In `DevLogTimeline.vue` (from E1-S1), add a visual indicator (small icon or badge) showing whether the summary is AI-generated vs auto-generated, using a client-side heuristic

## Files to Create/Modify
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `apps/server/src/enricher.ts` | Modify | Update buildAutoSummary() to include project/branch context (lines 417-431) |
| `.claude/hooks/stop.py` | Modify | Ensure --summarize flag is passed to send_event.py (if not already) |
| `.claude/hooks/session_end.py` | Modify | Ensure --summarize flag is passed to send_event.py (if not already) |
| `apps/client/src/components/DevLogTimeline.vue` | Modify | Add AI vs auto summary indicator |

## Testing
- [ ] Test 1: Send a Stop event with `summary: "Implemented user auth module"` -> dev log uses that exact summary
- [ ] Test 2: Send a SessionEnd event without summary -> dev log uses auto-generated summary including project name and branch
- [ ] Test 3: Auto-generated summary includes branch name (e.g., "3 file edits, 2 commands across 5 files on feature/auth")
- [ ] Test 4: DevLogTimeline correctly identifies and labels AI vs auto summaries
- [ ] Test 5: Hooks send --summarize for Stop and SessionEnd event types

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] AI summaries are preferred over auto-generated when available
- [ ] Auto-generated summaries include meaningful context (project, branch)
- [ ] Client visually distinguishes summary sources
